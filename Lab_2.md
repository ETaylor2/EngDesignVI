## Command Line & Terminal

The first few commands were straight forward and provided me with the intuitive information. Hostname returns the unique identifier of the name of your computer. Env shows the environment that your device operates in. Ps shows the active processes the system is going through and how long it has been going on for. Pwd returns the path of your current directory.

Gitclone, cd iot, and ls allows the user to copy files from Github, cd moves the user into the given directory, and ls shows the folders and files that are within the directory that the user is in. Cd without putting the directory brings the user back into the previous directory. Df displays information on the disk space availible and the capacities of said disks. Mkdir creats a new directory if it doesn't already exist, and in this case I already had a demo file so it didn't create a file.
