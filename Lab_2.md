## Command Line & Terminal

The first few commands were straight forward and provided me with the intuitive information. Hostname returns the unique identifier of the name of your computer. Env shows the environment that your device operates in. Ps shows the active processes the system is going through and how long it has been going on for. Pwd returns the path of your current directory.

Gitclone, cd iot, and ls allows the user to copy files from Github, cd moves the user into the given directory, and ls shows the folders and files that are within the directory that the user is in. Cd without putting the directory brings the user back into the previous directory. Df displays information on the disk space availible and the capacities of said disks. Mkdir creats a new directory if it doesn't already exist, and in this case I already had a demo file so it didn't create a file.

Where things start to get tricky is with the next line: Nano. What this does is create an interface that allows the user to edit text in command line instead of going to the file manually. This temporarily takes you out of command line to do this, which intially may shock some users as the GUI isn't as intuitive as it really is.

Cat presents the contents of the file in commandline, not in the NANO GUI. The cp and mv do similar things, the first copying one file's contents into another and the later command moving the contents from one file to the other (cp keeps the old file while mv does not). Rm simply removes a file.
