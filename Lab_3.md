## Exploring Python 

Prior to starting this lab, I already had Python and have a pretty good relationship with it. I'm currently taking a graduate-level python class currently so I would say I am somewhat already familiar with python on the same level as c++ now. 

With that in mind, after I tried to run the first julian.py file, it ran but unfortunately did not complete due to a missing import, see image below.
