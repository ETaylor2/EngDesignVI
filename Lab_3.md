## Exploring Python 

Prior to starting this lab, I already had Python and have a pretty good relationship with it. I'm currently taking a graduate-level python class currently so I would say I am somewhat already familiar with python on the same level as c++ now. 

With that in mind, after I tried to run the first julian.py file, it ran but unfortunately did not complete due to a missing import, see image below.

My first troubleshooting technique included trying to run other python files in the folder and there would be a missing file from the import.  See below.

After some research, I learned that in order to download the required python packages, I had to update my pip package installer, which was outdated. I learned this because as I tried to use [pip install jdcal], my terminal would return [pip command not found]. I also figured out that I should be using pip3 instead of pip because im using python3, which sounds a lot more intuitive than I thought.
