# Lab 5
  - I pledge by my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System

## Paho & MQTT

To start off this lab, like many other labs, I had to use homebrew to install a few packages. I installed mosquitto. I created a new virtual environment (myenv)  to download the specific files (paho-mqtt). In the screenshot below it was also evident that my pip3 was outdated, so I also took the liberty to update that as well.

After running the client, I had some success.

I then tried setting up two different terminal windows, one for publishing, the other for subscribing. These are the results.
