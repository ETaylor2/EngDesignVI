 - I pledge by my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System
 
## Starting Up 

Before starting Lab 1, I had to install a few minor packages including but not limited to a few homebrew installations. I also made sure to read up on what the GHDL is and how the GTKwave application works tangent to GHDL. 

Admittedly, I intially attempted to do the lab without downloading the required software becasue I believed I had everything I needed already. I not only had to install more packages, but also update much of the already owned software inbedded in X-Code since I work on a MacOS.
