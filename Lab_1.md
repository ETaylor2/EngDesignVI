# Lab 1 
 - I pledge by my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System
 
## Starting Up 

Before starting Lab 1, I had to install a few minor packages including but not limited to a few homebrew installations. I also made sure to read up on what the GHDL is and how the GTKwave application works tangent to GHDL. 

Admittedly, I intially attempted to do the lab without downloading the required software becasue I believed I had everything I needed already. I not only had to install more packages, but also update much of the already owned software inbedded in X-Code since I work on a MacOS. 

The first step towards any new program is the "Hello World" function, to which I followed easily with this result:

## Half-Adder

After completing the Hello World project, I decided to move onto the Half-Adder example. My first attempt led to the below screenshot.

## Tff
Looking up multiple solutions online and seeing what my other peers have done for this example, I have tried to recreate the tff program. My results for the first trial are shown below:

As you can see, even though my ghdl is downloaded I am still facing issues with running the program due to the command not being found.
