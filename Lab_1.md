# Lab 1 
 - I pledge by my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System
 
## Starting Up 

Before starting Lab 1, I had to install a few minor packages including but not limited to a few homebrew installations. I also made sure to read up on what the GHDL is and how the GTKwave application works tangent to GHDL. 

Admittedly, I intially attempted to do the lab without downloading the required software becasue I believed I had everything I needed already. I not only had to install more packages, but also update much of the already owned software inbedded in X-Code since I work on a MacOS. 

The first step towards any new program is the "Hello World" function, to which I followed easily with this result:

## Tff
Looking up multiple solutions online and seeing what my other peers have done for this example, I have tried to recreate the tff program. My results for the first trial are shown below:

As you can see, even though my ghdl is downloaded I am still facing issues with running the program due to the command not being found. 

After further conversations with the professor and a 1-on-1 meeting, I came to three conclusions which helped me complete the lab:
 1. Mac users cannot fully utilize the terminal to complete this lab.
 2. The GTKwave progam does not automatically zoom out for its users to get the most relevant information.
 3. The lab includes instructions for those who are mac users which makes it easier in some ways for them to complete the lab.  
Taking these points into account, I applied what I learned and found the results I was looking for. My success is shown below:

## Half-Adder

After completing the Hello World project, I decided to move onto the Half-Adder example. My first attempt led to the below screenshots.

 #### After doing the Tff I discovered conclusions that helped shape the rest of the lab.
